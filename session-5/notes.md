# Session 5: A Brief Tour of Logic Circuits

You can build any gates with just NAND, just AND and OR, or just NOR. Most chips are built with just NAND gates.

When we say "0" or "1" in a gate, we mean that anything less/greater than 0.5 volts represents 0 and 1 respectively.

How to remember gate symbols for AND: it's like the `D` of AND and the `O` of OR.

Single bit half adder: XOR for Sum, AND for Carry Out.

In modern systems, we don't use ripple adders because we don't want to wait for the propogation. Instead, we use Carry-lookahead adders.
