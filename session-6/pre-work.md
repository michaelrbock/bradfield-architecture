# Session 6: Sequential Circuit Components (Pre-Work)

How do we remember even one bit of information?

Connect the output of a gate back to the input to "remember" something: the output of an OR back to one of it's inputs.

TODO: pic.

Cross-connected NOR gate = *S-R (Set-Reset) Latch*.

TODO: pic.

Use just a single input and remember the output, instead of two inputs. 

S-R Latch with an enable: can only click set or reset when enable is also on.

TODO: pic.

D Latch: a single input with an enable (can only switch output by turning on *both* enable and input).

TODO: pic.

Can think of the "enable" input as a clock tick/pulse instead.
